# NetLogo Simulation - Battle of Bunker Hill

## Project Description

This project explores the impact of colonial engagement distance and British formational tactics on casualties during the Battle of Bunker Hill through a NetLogo simulation. The Battle of Bunker Hill, fought during the early stages of the American Revolutionary War, was a pivotal moment that demonstrated the resilience of the colonial forces and the challenges faced by the British army.

### Research Question
How does colonial engagement distance and British formational tactics impact the casualties during the Battle of Bunker Hill?

### Hypothesis
The hypothesis posits that British reliance on close-order formations led to higher British casualties and lower colonist casualties. Additionally, shorter engagement distances by the colonists increased British casualties while also leading to higher colonial casualties.

### Variables

- **Independent Variables:**
  - Colonial engagement distance
  - British formational tactics (e.g., Line, Column, Square formations)
  - Dimensions of British troop formations (rows/columns)

- **Dependent Variables:**
  - British casualties
  - Colonial casualties

### Methodology
  
The simulation models both the British and Colonial forces, focusing on the impact of different British troop formations (such as lines, columns, and squares) and the engagement distances set by the Colonial forces. By manipulating the variables, this simulation allows for an analysis of how formation types and engagement distance influence the outcome of the battle in terms of casualties. The results of this simulation aim to shed light on the effectiveness of British tactics and the role of colonial forces in influencing the course of the battle.


## How to Run
Running our NetLogo Simulation is very simple. We are utilizing just one file: group36_battleofbunkerhill.nlogo. You can open this file directly in NetLogo.

## Adjustable Values
By default, the adjustable values will default to their historical values. The adjustable values in our model are distance-to-shoot and British-TroopColumns. distance-to-shoot is the range that colonists can shoot at. British-TroopColumns is the number of columns used in the British line formation.
