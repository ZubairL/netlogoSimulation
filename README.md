## How to Run
Running our NetLogo Simulation is very simple. We are utilizing just one file: group36_battleofbunkerhill.nlogo. You can open this file directly in NetLogo.

## Adjustable Values
By default, the adjustable values will default to their historical values. The adjustable values in our model are distance-to-shoot and British-TroopColumns. distance-to-shoot is the range that colonists can shoot at. British-TroopColumns is the number of columns used in the British line formation.
